Atlas keeps everything offline-first so you can work on confidential projects without
worrying about cloud leaks.

The HP EliteBook 830 G5 has four cores and eight threads, which is enough to run a 3B
quantised model from Ollama while still leaving headroom for background tasks.

Voice control defaults to push-to-talk. Wake-word mode is optional because it requires a
continuous audio stream and increases CPU usage.

The planner is heuristic in this release; swapping in an LLM only requires updating
`PlannerService.generate_plan` with a call to Ollama or OpenAI and handling JSON output.

Windows automation relies on pywinauto, pyautogui, psutil, and pyperclip. Each module is
wrapped in skills that gracefully degrade when imports fail.

Semantic search combines notes, tasks, chats, and optional Documents indexing so the
assistant can recall project context quickly.

Brand colours follow the black (#0B0B0E) and gold (#E5B80B) motif, with slate surfaces and
ink text for secondary emphasis.

Plugins live inside the `plugins/` directory and expose a `run(payload)` callable. They can
read local files, query APIs, or orchestrate automation once permission is granted.

Use slash commands like `/task add "Ship v0.7" --due 2024-08-01` inside chat to convert
conversation into structured actions without leaving the conversation flow.

Documents indexing is optionalâ€”set `INDEX_DOCUMENTS=true` and run `make index-docs` to
chunk text files from your Documents folder into the RAG pipeline.

The professional butler voice uses pyttsx3 with a moderate speech rate so responses feel
relaxed but still efficient.
