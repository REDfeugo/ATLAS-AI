# Windows Control Skills

The control service exposes safe wrappers around Windows automation libraries. Each tool
has metadata (summary, args, risk, permission tier) defined in
`apps/api_fastapi/services/control_service.py`.

## Confirmation flow

High-risk tools trigger a confirmation prompt unless a `confirm_token` is provided.
The UI surfaces this as a gold modal with step-by-step preview.

## Rollback guidance

* File operations write into `data/storage/` by default to prevent accidents.
* Clipboard writes are reversibleâ€”`clip read` shows the previous value.
* Playwright actions run headless and target placeholder pages. Extend with caution by
  adding allowlists per domain.

## Extending skills

1. Add a new function to `skills/windows/` with docstrings and simulated fallbacks.
2. Register the tool in `ControlService._build_registry` with appropriate risk tier.
3. Update `docs/16_COMMAND_GRAMMAR.md` with the new command syntax.
4. Include manual QA steps in `docs/11_TESTING_AND_QA.md`.
